Ngrok Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have an ngrok account and copy your Authtoken from:
   https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

2. Add your Authtoken (replace <AUTHTOKEN> with your real one):
   ngrok config add-authtoken <AUTHTOKEN>

3. Run the Streamlit app locally (inside project root):
   streamlit run ui/app.py

4. In a new terminal window, start ngrok tunnel:
   ngrok http 8501

5. Copy the HTTPS Forwarding URL shown by ngrok (e.g., https://random-id.ngrok-free.app)
   and share it with others to access your app.

Notes:
- Keep both terminals (Streamlit and ngrok) running while sharing the app.
- Free ngrok accounts generate a new URL each time you start; upgrade for a fixed domain.
